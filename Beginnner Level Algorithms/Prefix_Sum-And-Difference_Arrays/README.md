Prefix Sum & Difference Arrays: A Powerful Combo
Overview

This guide explains how Prefix Sum and Difference Arrays work together to solve problems involving range queries and range updates efficiently.

    Prefix Sum optimizes range sum queries (O(1) after O(n) preprocessing).

    Difference Arrays optimize range updates (O(1) per update before reconstruction.

When combined, they enable efficient bulk updates followed by instant queries.
1. When to Use Them Together?
Problem Types

    Range Updates + Range Queries

        Apply multiple range updates (add/subtract values)

        Then answer range sum queries on the modified array

    Real-World Scenarios

        Stock price changes over days with periodic queries

        Game level scoring with dynamic modifiers

        Traffic flow analysis with time-windowed adjustments

2. How They Work Together
Step-by-Step Workflow

    Initialize a Difference Array

        Convert the original array into its difference array for efficient range updates.

    Apply Range Updates

        Modify the difference array in O(1) per update.

    Reconstruct the Array

        Convert the difference array back to the actual values using prefix sum.

    Compute Prefix Sum Array

        Build a prefix sum array from the reconstructed values for O(1) range queries.

    Answer Queries Instantly

        Use the prefix sum array to get range sums in constant time.
