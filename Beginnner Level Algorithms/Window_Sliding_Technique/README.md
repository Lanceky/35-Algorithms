Problem:


Given an array of numbers and a fixed window size k, find the maximum sum of any consecutive subarray of size k.

Example:

    Array: [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2]

    Window size: k = 3

    Answer: 9 (from [5, 1, 3])

How It Works (Step-by-Step)

    First Window Sum:

        Take the first k numbers ([2, 1, 5]).

        Calculate their sum: 2 + 1 + 5 = 8.

        This is our starting maximum sum (max_sum = 8).

    Slide the Window Forward:

        Move the window right by 1 position (drop 2, add 1).

        New window: [1, 5, 1] ‚Üí Sum: 1 + 5 + 1 = 7.

        Compare to max_sum (8 > 7 ‚Üí Keep max_sum = 8).

    Repeat Until the End:

        Next window: [5, 1, 3] ‚Üí Sum: 5 + 1 + 3 = 9 ‚Üí New max_sum = 9.

        Next window: [1, 3, 2] ‚Üí Sum: 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 ‚Üí max_sum stays 9.

    Final Result:

        The highest sum found is 9.
#summary: 
1. Compute the sum of the first window of size k.
2. Slide the window one element at a time.
3. At each step, subtract the element that is left behind and add the new element.
4. Keep track of the maximum sum encountered.

Real-Life Analogy: The Ice Cream Shop Line üç¶

Imagine you own an ice cream shop, and every day, a line of customers forms outside. Each customer has a certain amount of money they‚Äôre willing to spend.
Problem:

You want to find the 3 consecutive customers (window size k = 3) whose combined spending is the highest possible so you can offer them a group discount.
How Sliding Window Works:

    First Group (Window):

        Customers: [$2, $1, $5]

        Total: $2 + $1 + $5 = $8

        Current max: $8

    Slide the Window Forward:

        Move right: Drop $2 (leftmost), add $1 (new rightmost).

        New group: [$1, $5, $1]

        Total: $1 + $5 + $1 = $7

        Max is still $8.

        Drop $1, add $3.

        New group: [$5, $1, $3]

        Total: $5 + $1 + $3 = $9

        New max! ‚Üí $9

    Final Result:

        The best group is [$5, $1, $3] with a total of $9.

Why This Works?

    Efficiency: Instead of recalculating the sum every time (like counting cash from scratch), you just:

        Subtract the leftmost customer‚Äôs cash (who left the window).

        Add the new customer‚Äôs cash (who entered the window).

    Real-World Parallel:

        Like a security camera tracking the busiest 3-minute segment in a store.

        Or a fitness tracker measuring your highest 10-step speed during a run.
