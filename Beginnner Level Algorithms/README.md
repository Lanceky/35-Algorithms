Question: Implement a Linear Search Algorithm
Problem Statement:

Write a Python function to perform a linear search on a list of integers. The function should take a list of integers (nums) and a target integer (target) as input and return the index of the target if it exists in the list. If the target is not found, the function should return -1.
Example:
Input: nums = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 3], target = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: The target value 7 exists at index 2 in the list.
