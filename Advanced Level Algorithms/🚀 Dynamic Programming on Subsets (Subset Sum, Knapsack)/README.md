ðŸš€ Dynamic Programming on Subsets (Subset Sum, Knapsack, and More)
1. Introduction: Why Dynamic Programming on Subsets?

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful optimization technique that breaks problems into smaller subproblems, stores their solutions, and reuses them to avoid redundant computations.

When dealing with subset-related problems (e.g., selecting a subset of elements that meet certain constraints), DP provides efficient solutions where brute-force methods fail due to exponential time complexity.
Key Concepts:

âœ” Optimal Substructure â€“ The optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of subproblems.
âœ” Overlapping Subproblems â€“ The same subproblems are solved multiple times (memoization helps).
âœ” State Representation â€“ Often involves a DP table (dp[i][j]) where:

    i tracks the elements considered so far.

    j tracks the constraint (e.g., sum, weight).

2. Real-World Applications
1. Subset Sum Problem

    Problem: Given a set of integers, is there a subset that sums to a target value?

    Use Case: Financial portfolio optimization (selecting investments that meet a target return).

2. 0/1 Knapsack Problem

    Problem: Given items with weights and values, select a subset that maximizes value without exceeding a weight limit.

    Use Case: Resource allocation (e.g., shipping cargo, cloud computing tasks).

3. Partition Equal Subset Sum

    Problem: Can an array be partitioned into two subsets with equal sums?

    Use Case: Fair division problems (e.g., splitting assets between two parties).
