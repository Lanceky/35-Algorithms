Dynamic Programming on Grids: Unique Paths & Minimum Path Sum

Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful technique for solving optimization problems by breaking them into smaller subproblems. When applied to grid-based problems, DP efficiently computes solutions for pathfinding, movement constraints, and cost minimization.
