 Dijkstra'sAlgorithm: The Complete Guide
1. Understanding the Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is a greedy, graph search algorithm that solves the single-source shortest path problem for a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights. It finds the shortest path from a starting node to all other nodes in the graph.
Key Properties

    Works on: Directed/undirected weighted graphs (non-negative weights only)

    Output: Shortest path distances from source to all nodes

    Optimality: Guarantees the shortest path when weights are non-negative

    Approach: Greedy algorithm that processes nodes in order of increasing path cost

2. Real-World Analogies
A. City Navigation (Like Google Maps)

Imagine you're in New York City and want to find the fastest route to all major landmarks:

    Nodes (Vertices): Landmarks (Times Square, Central Park)

    Edges: Roads with travel times as weights

    Dijkstra's Role: Calculates the quickest path to each landmark from your starting point

B. Network Packet Routing

    Nodes: Network routers

    Edges: Connections with latency as weights

    Dijkstra's Role: Determines the fastest path for data packets

C. Airline Route Planning

    Nodes: Airports

    Edges: Flight routes with flight durations as weights

    Dijkstra's Role: Finds the quickest connection between airports

3. Problem Statement

Given:

    A weighted graph (adjacency list format)

    A starting node

Objective:
Find the shortest path distance from the starting node to all other nodes in the graph.

Constraints:

    All edge weights must be non-negative

    The graph can be directed or undirected

Example Input:
python

graph = {
    'A': {'B': 2, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'C': 1, 'D': 7},
    'C': {'D': 3},
    'D': {}
}
start = 'A'

Expected Output:
python

{'A': 0, 'B': 2, 'C': 3, 'D': 6}
