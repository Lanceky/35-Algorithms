Detailed Explanation of Hashing

Hashing is a technique used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, typically using a hash function. These fixed-size values, or "hash codes," serve as keys for efficient data retrieval. Hashing is a fundamental concept in computer science and underpins many algorithms and data structures, such as hash tables, sets, and dictionaries.
How Hashing Works

    Hash Function: This is a function that takes an input (or key) and returns an integer (the hash code). A good hash function minimizes collisions, where different inputs produce the same hash code.

    Hash Table: This is an array-like structure where data is stored based on its hash code. When a key-value pair is inserted, the key is hashed to determine the index where the value will be stored.

    Collision Resolution: Since multiple inputs can generate the same hash code, collision resolution techniques like chaining or open addressing are used.

Real-Life Analogies

    Library System: Imagine a library where each book is given a unique identifier (hash code). When you need a book, you simply look for its identifier instead of searching through the entire library.

    Dictionary: A physical dictionary is like a hash table. Instead of reading every word to find the definition, you use the index (based on the first letters) to quickly locate the desired word.

Problem Statement
Problem:

Design an algorithm to find if a list contains duplicate elements. If duplicates exist, return True; otherwise, return False.
Constraints:

    Time complexity should be as efficient as possible.

    Handle scenarios with large datasets.

Solution in Python Using Hashing

The most common algorithm for solving this involves using a set, which is backed by a hash table. Here's how it works:

    Iterate through the list.

    For each element, check if it already exists in the set.

        If yes, return True.

        If no, add it to the set.

    If the loop completes without finding duplicates, return False.
